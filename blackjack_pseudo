If either player 1's score or player 2's score is above 21
    If player 1's score and player 2's score are both above 21
        Both players lose
    If player 1's score is above 21
        Player 2 wins
    If player 2's score is above 21
        Player 1 wins

    Else
        Player 2 wins


Rules
    All four card selected must be unique
    A player loses if the total of their two cards is greater than 21
    A player wins if their score is higher than the other player's
    Ace can be 1 or 11 (NTH)
